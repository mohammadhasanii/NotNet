## ðŸ“¢ A Stand Against Internet Censorship in Iran

**NotNet** is a collective initiative against the oppressive state of the internet in Iran. We believe in free, open, and unrestricted access to information, a right that has been systematically violated due to government-imposed restrictions, international sanctions, and the degradation of the national network.

## ðŸš¨ The Problem
The current state of the internet in Iran is defined by:
- **Severe censorship** â€“ Social media, news outlets, and global platforms are blocked.
- **Low internet speed** â€“ Bandwidth throttling and infrastructure neglect result in poor user experience.
- **Constant disruptions** â€“ Frequent blackouts, VPN restrictions, and deliberate interference.
- **Economic damage** â€“ Businesses, freelancers, and startups face massive losses due to internet instability.

## ðŸ”¥ Whoâ€™s Responsible?
- **Government policies** â€“ Filtering, forced localization, and suppression of online freedoms.
- **International sanctions** â€“ Restrictions that limit access to global services and investment in infrastructure.
- **Network mismanagement** â€“ Lack of investment in modern networking protocols and technologies.

## ðŸš€ Our Goal
We advocate for:
- **Lifting censorship** â€“ Free access to information and communication platforms.
- **Infrastructure development** â€“ Adoption of modern protocols like HTTP/3 and investment in fiber optics.
- **Global accessibility** â€“ Unrestricted access to cloud services, payment gateways, and international networks.
- **Digital freedom** â€“ The right to private, secure, and open internet access.

## ðŸ’¡ How You Can Help
- **Spread awareness** â€“ Share this repository and raise your voice.
- **Support alternative solutions** â€“ Advocate for VPNs, satellite internet, and decentralized web technologies.
- **Collaborate with us** â€“ Developers, activists, and researchers are welcome to contribute.

## ðŸ“œ Join Us
We are stronger together. If you believe in internet freedom, join **NotNet** and take a stand against oppression and digital restrictions.

ðŸ“¢ **Internet freedom is a right, not a privilege.**
