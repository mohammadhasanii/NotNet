# NotNet - Where there is no internet

## 📢 A Stand Against Internet Censorship in Iran

**NotNet** is a collective initiative against the oppressive state of the internet in Iran. We believe in free, open, and unrestricted access to information, a right that has been systematically violated due to government-imposed restrictions, international sanctions, and the degradation of the national network.

## 🚨 The Problem
The current state of the internet in Iran is defined by:
- **Severe censorship** – Social media, news outlets, and global platforms are blocked.
- **Low internet speed** – Bandwidth throttling and infrastructure neglect result in poor user experience.
- **Constant disruptions** – Frequent blackouts, VPN restrictions, and deliberate interference.
- **Economic damage** – Businesses, freelancers, and startups face massive losses due to internet instability.

## 🔥 Who’s Responsible?
- **Government policies** – Filtering, forced localization, and suppression of online freedoms.
- **International sanctions** – Restrictions that limit access to global services and investment in infrastructure.
- **Network mismanagement** – Lack of investment in modern networking protocols and technologies.

## 🚀 Our Goal
We advocate for:
- **Lifting censorship** – Free access to information and communication platforms.
- **Infrastructure development** – Adoption of modern protocols like HTTP/3 and investment in fiber optics.
- **Global accessibility** – Unrestricted access to cloud services, payment gateways, and international networks.
- **Digital freedom** – The right to private, secure, and open internet access.

## 💡 How You Can Help
- **Spread awareness** – Share this repository and raise your voice.
- **Support alternative solutions** – Advocate for VPNs, satellite internet, and decentralized web technologies.
- **Collaborate with us** – Developers, activists, and researchers are welcome to contribute.

## 📜 Join Us
We are stronger together. If you believe in internet freedom, join **NotNet** and take a stand against oppression and digital restrictions.

📢 **Internet freedom is a right, not a privilege.**
